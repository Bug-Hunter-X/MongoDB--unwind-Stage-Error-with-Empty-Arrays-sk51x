# MongoDB $unwind Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines and provides a solution for handling it gracefully.

The problem arises when the `$lookup` stage returns an empty array for the `as` field in some documents.  The `$unwind` operator then attempts to unwind an empty array, resulting in an error.

The solution involves adding a conditional check using `$ifNull` or `$cond` to handle such scenarios. This prevents errors and ensures the pipeline continues processing without interruption.

## How to Reproduce

1. Create two collections: `collection1` and `collection2`.
2. Populate them with documents, ensuring that some documents in `collection1` do not have corresponding entries in `collection2`.
3. Run the aggregation pipeline from `bug.js` against `collection1`.
4. Observe the error. 

## Solution

Review the `bugSolution.js` for the solution, implementing a conditional check to handle empty arrays, preventing any error.
